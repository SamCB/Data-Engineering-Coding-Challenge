Fairfax shareholders have overwhelmingly backed a takeover by Nine Entertainment, paving the way for both companies to merge by the end of this year.
Key points:
Nine's next step is to obtain court approval for the takeover on Nov 27
Provided it agrees, Nine's takeover of Fairfax will complete on Dec 7
The former CEO of Domain tried to block the deal, but was unsuccessful.
At the Fairfax annual general meeting today, more than 80 per cent of votes were in favour of the deal.
Antony Catalano, the former head of real estate website Domain, tried to block the deal by submitting a last-minute bid for 19.9 per cent of the newspaper publisher's shares on Sunday evening.
He had asked, in a letter, for the AGM to be delayed for two weeks so his 11th-hour proposal could be considered.
However, the Fairfax board knocked back Mr Catalano's offer because it was not a "superior proposal" and, therefore, unable to be considered.
"The letter contains no actual proposal that could be considered by Fairfax shareholders as an alternative to the proposed scheme of arrangement with Nine," Fairfax said in a statement.
"The Fairfax board believes that the value and strategic opportunities offered by the scheme reflect a compelling proposition for Fairfax shareholders."
Mr Catalano said he would take legal action to prevent the deal going through.
Deal to be completed in early December
The merger — which will be the biggest shake-up of the Australian media landscape in decades — was already approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) earlier this month.
ACCC chairman Rod Sims said at the time that Australia would be "slightly worse off" because of the 
lessening of competition in the news market
. It would leave Australia with four major media players, instead of five.
But the competition watchdog approved the deal because it would not "substantially" lessen competition, particularly given the recent rise of online news providers such as The Guardian, The New Daily, BuzzFeed, Crikey and The Daily Mail.
Nine's takeover of Fairfax is subject to final court approval on November 27.
Provided it obtains court approval, the merger is scheduled to be completed on December 7, with the combined group beginning business on December 10.
It also means the Fairfax brand name — after 177 years of operation — will cease to exist.
The new entity, which will simply be called "Nine", will own the free-to-air Nine Network, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian Financial Review, a majority stake in Domain, streaming service Stan and a 54.5 per cent stake in radio network Macquarie Media.
It will be led by Hugh Marks and Peter Costello, the chief executive and chairman of Nine Entertainment.
Fairfax shares price jumped 2.4 per cent to 63 cents at 12:30pm (AEDT), but still remains around its lowest value since mid-February.
Nine Entertainment's share price also lifted sharply, up 2.3 per cent to $1.67. Its value is also around a nine-month low.
